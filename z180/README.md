# Z88DK

You must have a working version of Z88DK either placed or simlinked in this folder.

The version of Z88DK required is:

```text
commit 492cb971987d88f91d2b046ce99d5bd34f6fadea (HEAD)
Author: dom <dom@suborbital.org.uk>
Date:   Fri Feb 3 20:05:13 2023 +0000

    (widegfx) Missing sdcc export
```

Perhaps other versions will work.  This is the one I used and I know this works
for me.
